# Asks the cluster to start, in each guarded namespace, a pod on an image the pipeline did not sign, one on an image
# signed by someone else and one on an image of ours that the namespace does not run, and keeps Kyverno's answers in
# deploy/test/admission-refusals.json, for milestone 7's red-team harness to show. Run it with every image policy
# enforcing (Deny), as `main` has them: not during a `try-the-line` run, which switches `factory-images` to Audit, and
# which scripts/policy-hash.ts, run first, refuses, as Argo CD then reports the policy changed.
#
# Each request is a server-side dry run: it passes through admission exactly as a real one does, and nothing is made.
# The pods meet the restricted Pod Security Standard the namespaces enforce, so a refusal is the image policy's own.
#
#   unsigned        the factory's (or, in `website`, the app's) amd64 image from inside a build: build.yml signs the
#                   multi-platform index it pushes, not each platform's manifest in it, so this one is ours, on GHCR,
#                   by digest, and unsigned
#   other-identity  an image the namespace runs, on our GHCR, signed, but not by build.yml on main: the arm64 image
#                   from inside the same build of the factory (in `website`, of the factory's browser), which
#                   .github/workflows/other-identity.yml signed on the branch `refusal/other-identity`, keyless, as
#                   itself. So it gets past the checks of its registry and its place, and is refused for its
#                   signature. The branch is kept, unmerged, so the workflow that signed it can be read, and its
#                   identity is never build.yml's on main. In `flagd`, where no image of ours runs, it is refused for
#                   its place first, as `misplaced` is
#   misplaced       ours, on GHCR, but not an image the namespace runs, so refused before its signature is looked
#                   at: in `website` the factory's own image (only its browser runs there), in `scoreboard` the
#                   factory's browser (only the factory's own image runs there), in `flagd` the factory's own (no
#                   image of ours runs there), elsewhere the app's
#   other-digest    in `flagd` alone, flagd's own image at an earlier release, by its digest: its copy admits the one
#                   digest it names, and no other from flagd's repository
#
# `flagd` has no `unsigned` case: no image of ours runs there, so one is refused as misplaced before its signature is
# looked at.
#
# Before it asks, it reads who signed each image of ours (scripts/signed-by.ts, as the deploy watch reads it), and
# stops unless the unsigned ones carry no signature, the other-identity ones only another's, and the misplaced ones
# build.yml's on main; each answer keeps what it found. The record keeps the hash of the four copies of the policy it
# was taken against (scripts/policy-hash.ts), which apps/factory/test/refusal-records.test.ts holds to deploy/.
